    "* The web-page should be hosted on your GitHub Pages site (Week 7).\n",

    "* The story should have a brief introduction to the dataset so new readers from outside the class can understand what's going on.\n",
    "* Your story should include three visualizations. Not more than three, not less than three (but multi-panel figures are OK). The figures should be one of each of the following types\n",

    "    * Aim to make the figures visually consistent (color, fonts, etc)\n",
    "    * Follow the recommendations from my video on nice figures (Week 2, part 3)\n",
    "* In terms of the amount of text, I envision something like 500-1500 words (including figure captions). Try to write in your own words - the LLMs have a tendency to write a lot of text and not be so precise. So if the writing is all elegantly written but empty prose, we will be critical. It is OK, however, to have the LLM help you get the grammer, etc. right.\n",
    "* It is a plus if you can back up some of your findings with external sources, such as news stories from the area, looking up which building is located at some set of lat,lon coordinates, or similar. (So when you see something happening at some time/place in the data, see if you can understand it more deeply by investigating outside the dataset.) Use real references at the end of the text to organize your links to the outside world."
