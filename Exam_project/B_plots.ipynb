Furthermore, it can be seen that 90.8% of the bike stands located at a facade are privately owned, which is not a surprise, since most buildings are privately owned and therefore the councils need permission to build place a bike stand at a facade. This is the same argue for the location 'tæt på facade', since it might be private lot close to the private buildings. \n",

In general pavements and squares are publicly owned in Copenhagen, so when a council wants to place a new bike stand, an easy place to locate the bike stand will be a pavement or a square. \n",
